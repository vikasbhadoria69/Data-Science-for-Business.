###### Are you an aspiring entrepreneur who wants to maximize business revenue with Data Science and Artificial Intelligence? If the answer is, then this project is for you!
In this project I have shown how Data science can be used to solve problems in each Business department. I have solved 6 real world business problems using Data science.
## Data Science Key points:
Data Science is one of the hottest tech fields to be in right now! The field is exploding with opportunities and career prospects. Data Science is widely adopted in many sectors nowadays such as banking, healthcare, transportation and technology.
In business, Data Science is applied to optimize business processes, maximize revenue and reduce cost.
